This project was realised with [axelcoezard](https://github.com/axelcoezard).

The goal of this project is to reproduce the functioning of an IRC server that clients can connect to.

What is an IRC server? IRC stands for "Internet Relay Chat", which is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet. It is used for instant communication mainly in the form of group discussions through chat channels, but it can also be used for communication between two people.

The Internet operates using numerous standards and protocols to allow interoperability between connected machines. This project will help you to learn about one of those protocols.
